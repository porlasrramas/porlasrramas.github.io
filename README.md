# My Portfolio

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress. Please bear with me as I continue to develop and add content.

## Introduction

Welcome to my project! I am excited to share my journey with you as I build upon the amazing [Gatsby Starter Portfolio Minimal Theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal-theme) by Konstantin MÃ¼nster. This project is a fork of the original template and aims to create a unique and engaging experience.

## Project Status

At the moment, the project is under active development. I am in the process of customizing the theme, adding new features, and refining the content. My goal is to provide valuable resources and showcase my work in the best possible way.

## What to Expect

I will be regularly updating the project with new content, including blog posts, case studies, and portfolio pieces. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work towards creating a compelling and informative platform.
